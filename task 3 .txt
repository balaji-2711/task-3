Window:

2.The window object is supported by all browsers.
3.All global JavaScript objects , functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object.

5.This window object has the majority of the properties like length, innerWidth, innerHeight, name, if it has been closed, its parents, and more.
6.The window object represents the current browsing context . 
7.It holds things like window.location, window.history, window.screen, window.status, or the window.document .

Document:
1.The Document interface represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point into the web page's content, which is the DOM tree.
2.When an HTML document is loaded into a web browser , it becomes a document object. 
3.It is the root node of the HTML document. 
4.The document actually gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie, etc.
5.HTML documents, served with the "text/html" content type, also implement the HTMLDocument interface,
  whereas XML and SVG documents implement the XMLDocument interface.
